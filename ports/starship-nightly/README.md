## Information
Starship was built from the `v1.0.0` tag on 12/23/2024. You can build your own binaries by following the [BUILDING.md guide](starship/BUILDING.md).

## Installation
The supported ROM is the USA 1.1 Rev A version. You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the SHA-1 File Checksum Online at https://www.romhacking.net/hash/. The hash for a US 1.1 ROM is SHA-1: 09F0D105F476B00EFA5303A3EBC42E60A7753B7A.

Legally obtain your rom and place it in `ports/starship`, then start the port. Texture pack files can be added to the `ports/starship/mods` folder.

## Menu Navigation
There is a `starship.gptk` file you can use to change which button emulates F1 (default is L3). Some devices have a special button called `guide` that makes for a good F1 mapping.

## Adding Mods
Mods are available at the port's [Gamebanana Page](https://gamebanana.com/games/21612).

## Default Gameplay Controls
The port uses SDL controller mapping and controls can be remapped from the menu bar.
