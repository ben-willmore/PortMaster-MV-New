    "desc": "A source port of Ocarina of Time &amp; Master Quest. Ship of Harkinian features extensive and significant enhancements over the original game, such as improved performance, increased frame-rate, native ultra-widescreen support, and extensive mod support (especially compared to emulated versions of the original), among other features.",
    "inst": "You need to provide your own roms. See the [Shipwright](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/blob/develop/docs/supportedHashes.json) repository for a list of supported rom hashes. Gather your roms and put them in the `ports/soh` folder. Start the port, and on first run, your .otr files will be generated from the roms you provide. Note that only one `oot.otr` and `oot-mq.otr` will be made--if you provide more than one rom per game, strange things may occur. You *can* use pregenerated `.otr` files from elsewhere, but you may experience crashes.",
